CHAPTER I

MARSHALL SENDS FOR RICKARD


THE large round clock was striking nine as “Casey” Rickard’s dancing
step carried him into the outer office of Tod Marshall. The ushering
clerk, coatless and vestless in expectation of the third, hot spring
day, made a critical appraisement of the engineer’s get-up before he
spoke. Then he stated that Mr. Marshall had not yet come.

For a London tie and a white silk shirt belted into white serge
trousers were smart for Tucson. The clerks in the employ of the
Overland Pacific and of the Sonora and Yaqui Railroads had stared at
Rickard as he entered; they followed his progress through the room.
He was a newcomer in Tucson. He had not yet acquired the apathetic
habits of its citizens. He wore belts, instead of suspenders. His white
trousers, duck or serge, carried a newly pressed crease each morning.

The office had not reached a verdict on the subject of K. C. Rickard.
The shirt-sleeved, collarless clerks would have been quick to dub him a
dandy were it not for a page of his history that was puzzling them. He
had held a chair of engineering in some eastern city. He had resigned,
the wind-tossed page said, to go on the road as a fireman. His rapid
promotion had been spectacular; the last move, a few weeks ago, to fill
an office position in Tucson. The summons had found him on the west
coast of Mexico, where the Overland Pacific was pushing its tracks.

“You can wait here,” suggested the clerk, looking covertly at the shoes
of the man who a few years before had been shoveling coal on a Wyoming
engine. “Mr. Marshall said to wait.”
