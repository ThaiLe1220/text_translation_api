“Give him a year to change some of his fine habits!” wagered Smythe,
the stoop-shouldered clerk, as the door of the inner office closed.

“To change his habits less!” amended the office wit. And then they
fell to speculating what Marshall was going to do with him. What
pawn was he in the game that every one in Tucson followed with eager
self-interested concern? Marshall’s was the controlling hand in Arizona
politics; the maker of governors, the arbiter of big corporations;
president of a half-dozen railroads. Not a move of his on the board
that escaped notice.

On the other side of the door, Rickard was echoing the office question.
This play job, where did it lead to? He had liked his work, under
Stratton. There had been some pretty problems to meet--what did
Marshall mean to do with him?

The note had set the appointment for nine. Rickard glanced at his
watch, and took out his _Engineering Review_. It would be ten before
that door opened on Tod Marshall!

He knew that, on the road, Marshall’s work began at dawn. “A man won’t
break from overwork, or rust from underwork, if he follows the example
of the sun,” Rickard had often heard him expound his favorite theory.
“It is only the players, the sybarites, who can afford to pervert the
arrangement nature intended for us.” But in Tucson, controlled by
the wifely solicitude of his Claudia, he was coerced into a regular
perversion. His office never saw him until the morning was half gone.
